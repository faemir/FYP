This repository holds the source code for my final year project - a procedural racing game that takes inspiration from zero-g racing games such as wipeout and f-zero, combined with track and difficulty generated using player-analysing algorithms.

The project is using Unreal Engine 4, and is leveraging splines for level generation. The end-result will have the majority of the code in C++, but for prototyping will first be done in BluePrint (hence the binary files).
